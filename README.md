# Restaurant-Management-Website

Hello Guys!!

I am Deepesh Agarwal currently pursuing B.Tech from Jodhpur Institute Of Engineering And Technology, Jodhpur.

About Project:
This is an practice project which i have created. The idea of building this project was taken from Geeks For Geeks Website. 
In this project firstly i have created a explore page through which a new user can explore our website easily. 

After that an homepage is created where different types of cuisines that are available is displayed and at the last section of the homepage the location and the directions (map) is included.
Now, after the homepage multiple different webpages related to the cuisines were created i.e. 
about the North Indian Cuisine, South Indian Cuisine, Chienese Cuisine, along with the menu sections in it.

A Review and feedback page is developed through which the feedbacks of the customers can be taken. 
A Reservations page is developed through which the user/customer can book/reserve the banquet hall, birthday party hall, cafe & restro. 
All the information from reservations page is stored in the google sheets which is connected using the JavaScript.

** The information and pictures added in the project are taken from different food websites and unsplash.com, 
the pictures and information displayed in the webpages are just for reference only. 
All credits of pictures and informations are given to their respective owners. **
